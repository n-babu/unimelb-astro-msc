# Resources for Astro MSc Students
For resources useful to Astro MSc students at Unimelb (mostly the assessment requirements doc). There might be more added later. 

Note: This repository is not an official repository of the University of Melbourne. It is purely made by students for other students. 

Also, Katie's website also has a bunch of useful resources so I'll link it here: https://sites.google.com/view/unimelb-astro-resources/home
